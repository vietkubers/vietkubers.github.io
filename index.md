Hello,
  
Welcome to **Vietnam Kubernetes Community**

Kubernetes has been an evolving technology for deploying containerized applications. Powered by Google, Kubernetes is capable of running billions of containers per week, allowing you to scale your application without increasing your ops team. And yet, we have not had an organized community in Vietnam to gather and discuss this budding technology.  

VietKubers was founded on the basis of learning and sharing our knowledge together in a thriving environment. Founded by the former OpenStack Team at Fujitsu, we hope to bridge the gap of knowledge in the open-source community and lay a new foundation for Kubernetes users in Vietnam in the near future.
